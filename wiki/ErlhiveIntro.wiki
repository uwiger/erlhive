#summary Introduction to Erlhive.

= Introduction =

Erlhive is a multi-user web services framework,
with some rather unusual features:

Each user account is equipped with:

  * A private name space
  * A public and a private store in a real-time database
  * Public and private code modules
  * A transaction-based file system

The programming environment in Erlhive is Erlang-based,
and the real-time database is Mnesia. All code modules
stored in Erlhive are "safe-compiled", ensuring that 
application code cannot perform tasks that would 
violate the integrity of other applications and data.

People familiar with Mnesia will be surprised at how
much one can do safely in an Erlhive transaction:
You can create ETS tables and processes, and send 
messages to your own processes. Modules like `file`,
`gen_server` and even `gen_tcp` can be used safely,
thanks to the "safe-compilation" process.

Erlhive is still in early beta. Please join the developer mailing list via [http://erlhive.sourceforge.net/ the Erlhive Project page]

More will come here. Hopefully, this will evolve into an online manual on Erlhive.

There is an ErlhiveUsersGuide, which is getting a bit long in the tooth. I've pasted it in from the sourceforge svn repository and added a little Wiki markup.
